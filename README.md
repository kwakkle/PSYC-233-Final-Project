# PSYC-233-Final-Project

## About the Class  
**PSYC 233: Research Methods in Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience**  
This course introduces the fundamentals of research design, data collection, and data analysis in the context of cognitive and neuroscience research. It emphasizes critical thinking, experimental methodology, and hands-on experience with datasets and tools used in psychological research through the usage of MATLAB. 

## About the Project  
For my final project, I used the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)** dataset, available on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). NHANES is a program of the National Center for Health Statistics, responsible for producing vital and health statistics through comprehensive health examinations and surveys.

I created an **interactive NHANES Dashboard** in MATLAB that allows users to generate bar plots based on selected variables. This project focuses on two specific datasets:  
- **Mental health** (depression screener)  
- **Sleep disorders**  

The project aims to investigate the relationship between sleep patterns and mental health.
